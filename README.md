# Silent-Connect-Frontend
## About
A video call system that utilizes sign language detection and recognition technology to enable specially-abled individuals to communicate seamlessly with their peers. We have named this project “Silent-Connect”. After countless late nights and early mornings, we were able to complete a prototype that is now able to convert sign language into text and speech, opening up new possibilities for those with speech and hearing impairments.
